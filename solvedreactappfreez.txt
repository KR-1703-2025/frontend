I had this problem, mine got stuck at

Creating a new React app in C:\project

Installing packages. This might take a couple of minutes.
Installing react, react-dom, and react-scripts...

[  ................] \ fetchMetadata: sill resolveWithNewModule react-is@4.0.0
The solution for me was to ensure npm is up to date by running:

npm install npm@latest -g

After this, create-react-app worked correctly.
