I believe there is no answer to your question. If you google for 'wrong css order' you may found github issues for webpack older than 2 years. Like that one https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin/issues/548 and there are many others.

I have solved this by combining styles into one file. I use scss so did something like:

// main.scss

@import 'globals';
@import 'responsive';

and in js

import main.scss
