Did you try recovering your dependencies? run npm install

and make sure from Node and npm version at least npm more than 6 and node more than 10

npm -v 
node -v
and finally, try to delete the node_modules and package-lock and do npm i again



I had this issue before so I will share what my issue was:

in package.json just verify the integrity of you start command. Also try npm run start (add run to it)

"scripts": {
  "start": "react-scripts start",
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "test": "react-scripts test",
  "eject": "react-scripts eject"
}
