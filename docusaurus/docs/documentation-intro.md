Welcome to the Create React App documentation!

## Navigation

You can explore various topics using the table of contents:
- **On desktop:** The navigation menu is available on the left sidebar.
- **On mobile:** Tap the menu icon (☰ or ⇄ arrows) in the top left corner to view the navigation.

## Looking for React Docs?

The documentation for React itself is located on a separate website: **[reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/)**.

This website is only about Create React App.

## Something Missing?
