You absolutely should not be installing react-scripts globally.
You also don't need ./node_modules/react-scripts/bin/ in package.json as this answer implies.

If you see this:

npm ERR! UpScore@0.6.0 start: `react-scripts start`
npm ERR! spawn ENOENT
It just means something went wrong when dependencies were installed the first time.

I suggest doing these three steps:

npm install -g npm@latest to update npm because it is sometimes buggy.
rm -rf node_modules to remove the existing modules.
npm install to re-install the project dependencies.
This should fix the problem.
