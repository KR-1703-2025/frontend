I don't have a typescript version but have you tried gulp-remove-code? You can surround your JavaScript with some comments to remove whatever code you want when running your production build. This is from the above linked page:

var removeCode = require('gulp-remove-code');

gulp.src('./src/file.js')
  .pipe(removeCode({ production: true }))
  .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist'))


//removeIf(production) 
value = JSON.stringify({key: 'value'}, null, 2);
//endRemoveIf(production)
